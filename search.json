    "text": "Engineering\nMudd’s general Engineering gives its students a strong background in a variety of subjects, but by far what has clicked with me the most in my schooling has been electrical engineering, especially through research.\nWhether it was working under PI Dr. Jason Gallicchio on software defined radio, or within the Harvey Mudd Biophotonics Lab with Dr. Joshua Brake, I’ve learned to work with electromagnetic waves, their generation, and their processing.\nMy favorite courses at HMC have included E&M, Data Structures for C++, Digital Design and Computer Architecture, analog circuit design, and Systems Engineering."
