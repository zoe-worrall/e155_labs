(Wisdom): This is street smarts, and although it can't really be taught, it is always good to introduce new material to kids in class. I think running small sessions of activities that have unexpected or unrecognizable projects would aid in improving \"wisdom smartness\".\n3.

This smartness was my primary inspiration for thinking this in elementary school; knowing social interactions, when to speak, what is funny to say, when to say it, is difficult. As adults we've honed in on proper timing in converstaions, or proper topics to discuss, but as children most of the time this is only learned through peer-to-peer interaction. I'd say that in this case, the problem is less about teaching Charisma \"smartness\" and more about acknowledging it; potentially in school, especially lower levels of schooling, taking time to acknowledge feats of charisma, or running small programs where students share what they admire about how other people interact with them.
