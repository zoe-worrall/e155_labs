By the end of summer, 2023, the system was performing rudimentary imaging of moving liquid encased in diffusing material that was otherwise invisible to the naked eye and the camara.\n* **Fluorescent Imaging** – I created a basic CAD design for implementing LED lights on top of the box that would be kept out of the box to prevent overheating.
