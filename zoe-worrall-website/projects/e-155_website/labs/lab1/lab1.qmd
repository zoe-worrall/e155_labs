## Lab 1: FPGA and MCU Setup and Testing

### Introduction
The goal of this lab was initial setup and confirmation of FPGA control of on-board LEDs and attached GPIO pin. This was done through the control of three leds: **D6**, **D7**, and **D8**, as well as seven GPIO pins: **45**, **3**, **44**, **9**, **13**, **12**, and **20** through the readout of on-board 4-pin DIP switch. By the end of the laboratory, the three switches were controlled as defined as seen in Tables 1(a) and 1(b), and the seven segment LED matrix as defined in Table 2.

**LED Logic for Table** 

:::
*The logic tables that were used for the led to switch mapping. @tbl-first refers to s[3] and s[2]; on the board, these are switches 1 and 2 (pins P32 and P31 respectively) to match where the highest order digits would be in a four digit number. By extensino, @tbl-second uses the two right-most switches (P35 and P32)*

### Hardware Setup

The first stage of this lab involved the soldering of the MCU and the FPGA, as well as all additional SMD and THT pins. To do this, the [E155 FA23 Development Board](https://pages.hmc.edu/brake/class/e155/fa23/assets/doc/E155%20Development%20Board%20Schematic.pdf) schematic was used. To begin, the SMD components were soldered. Careful consideration was given to make sure that the diodes were soldered in the right order and facing the correct direction. After these were soldered, THT components were then soldered, including the 4-pin DIP switch, the 8-pin DIP switch, and the female headers (@fig-imag1).

A board was connected via ribbon cable to the main Development board to allow for control of a breadboard via on-board GPIO pins (@fig-imag2). Once all pieces had been put together, the board was tested via a voltmeter via the screw terminal to ensure that the board could be properly powered (@fig-imag3)(@fig-imag4). The board through the screw terminal required +6 - +20 V; testing was done using 6V, and the board was confirmed to be running. The breadboard was tested using a multimeter to ensure that the 3.3V, 5.0V, and GND pins were properly generating the right voltage.
